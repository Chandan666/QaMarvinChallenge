Hello Chirag, 

# To Run this test in your local environment please follow below instructions

1. Make sure you have java and Eclipse ide is installed on your local machine.
2. I have used Eclipse ide, here you can use any other as per your convenience.
3. Once  you have these two set up add maven plugin to your ide.
4. After this setup is complete simply import the project into your ide workspace.
5. There is no need to download/install any other dependencies like selenium,testng.
6. Before running the project once refresh the project. So you have all the dependencies.
7. Go to the src/test/java/marvin_challenges folder
8. Right click on the first_challenge.java file and run it as a TestNgTest. This way it shows a report for you.


# FYI 

I used Edge browser here. with just small modifications you can do this in any browser. no need to install any drivers.
